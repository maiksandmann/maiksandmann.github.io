My colleague Diaa Radwan started to develop an Azure PostgreSQL workshop for all who wants to get more familar with the Azure PaaS offering of PostgreSQL. We are always looking for support in terms you have some fancy ideas, like to distribute and extend the workshop, feel free to get in contact with us. The online version of the workshop is available here - <a href="https://pg.azure-workshops.cloud/">The Azure PostgreSQL Workshop</a>.
